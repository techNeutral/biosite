                Henry Fuller is a 7 year old boy from Omaha Nebraska. He lives with his younger Brother Hudson and his Parents Brett and Jenny. 
                He is a first grader at Washington Elementary who loves to play sports with his favorite being Basketball. He plays basketball in a league at the YMCA on a team made up primarily of his friends from School. 
                His favorite athlete is Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors! Baseball is another one of his favorite sports and he plays on teams at Grover Little League. This past summer he made their all star team, 
                where several of the local little leagues combine their best players into a team and have a cross city tournament. His team finished in fourth place, missing out on third by a single run. He is also a big 
                fan of golf and does a couple of golf camps every summer, primarily through First Tee. He also takes every opportunity available to play local par 3 courses with his dad and occasionally his friends. Like 
                many other kids his age he loves playing video games. His favorite game right now is Plants vs Zombies, Garden Warfare: Battle for Neighborville, where he can get away with playing what is essentially a 
                shooter but since it doesn't have realistic guns his parents will let him play it. He also likes to play crafting games like Minecraft and Lego Fortnite, platformers like Mario and Astrobot, Sports games, 
                and anything that includes a pokemon.<br>
                <br>
                For his future he wants to continue in School where his favorite class that is not PE or Recess is reading. He hopes to grow up to be a basketball player or a Target Employee? We may have to work on setting 
                his goals a little higher on that last one but he is 7 and I will agree that Target has a lot of cool things there. He also really wants to travel to France because he heard they have good food there. His 
                dad did not realize he was such a foodie at only 7 years old, but agrees a vacation to France sounds alright!
