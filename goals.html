                    Henry really wants to be a professional basketball player when he grows up. He plays whenever he can.
                    He knows it is a lofty goal, though I don't think he really understands how lofty, but he's only seven
                    years old so I believe it is pretty important to dream big.

                    Speaking of dreaming big, if he cannot be a basketball player he wants to be a Target employee. Both him and His
                    little brother are huge fans of Target so I guess it makes sense. Although I will say as a former target employee
                    from a loooooooong time ago I can speak to the fact that this may not be as glamorous of a job as he currently believes.
                    I think maybe a dream that falls somewhere in between these two goals will likely develop over time and I am excited to learn
                    what it is.

                    When asking if he could go anywhere in the world, Henry quickly responded with France. He said he wants to go there because
                    he hears that they have good food. I expected an answer like Disney World or something along those lines especially since he
                    is a very picky eater and I canot imagine that he would find exactly what he is looking for there, with the exception of maybe the 
                    pastries.
