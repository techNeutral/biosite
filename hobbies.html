                        Henry's favorite sport is basketball! He plays on a team with a group of his friends mostly from his school
                        at the local YMCA. This season they are yet to lose a game. Henry likes basketball so much that there is almost always a ball
                        being dribbled on our hardwood floors because even though it is too cold to play outside he still wants to get some
                        practice in!

                    Henry's second favorite sport is baseball! He plays on a baseball team with his friends at Grover Little League.
                    His favorite position is pitcher. Last year he made the all star team for his little league and the picture shows 
                    him scoring a run in the torunament for the allstar team!

                    Another sport Henry really likes to play is Golf. He is a big fan of playing any course where he can hit the ball over water.
                    He has enrolled in a couple of golf camps over the last couple of summers and has started getting together with some of his friends
                    to play over the summer.

                    Henry loves video games. If he is not playing a sport he is probably playing a video game. Though often times he is playing
                    a sports video game like madden or NBA Live 2k25. His favorite game to play right now is a plants vs zombies garden warfare game.
